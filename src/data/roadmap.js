    fullDesc: `User experience design (UX design, UXD, UED, or XD) defines the experience a user would go through when interacting with a company, 
    its services, and its products.[1]User experience design is a User Centered Design approach because it considers the user's experience when using 
    a product or platform. Research, data analysis, and test results drive design decisions in UX design rather than aesthetic preferences and 
    opinions. Unlike user interface design, which focuses solely on the design of a computer interface, UX design encompasses all aspects of a 
    user's perceived experience with a product or website, such as its usability, usefulness, desirability, brand perception, and overall performance.
     UX design is also an element of the customer experience (CX), and encompasses all aspects and stages of a customer's experience and interaction
      with a company.
      
      SEO : Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page 
      from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. 
      Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including image search, video search, academic search,news search, and industry-specific
       vertical search engines.
      As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer-programmed algorithms that dictate search engine behavior,
       what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their targeted
        audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine results 
        page (SERP). These visitors can then potentially be converted into customers.

    fullDesc: `The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.  
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> and </p> surround and provide information about document text and may
       include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
      HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of
       web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former
        maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
         explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio,
          primarily using the <canvas> element, together with JavaScript.`,

    fullDesc: `Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a 
    markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the 
    World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This 
    separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
     characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying 
    the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
     and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
     on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate
      formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a
     particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium. Internet media type (MIME type) 
    text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
    In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit`,

    fullDesc: `JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
     alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party 
     libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based 
    object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
     It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other
     runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.
     The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
    The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[12] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a 
    more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.
During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded 
in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting
 language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language,
  while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.

Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December`,

    client-side functionality.React code is made of entities called components.These components are modular and reusable. React applications typically 
    consist of many layers of components. The components are rendered to a root element in the DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a
     component, values are passed between components through props (short for "properties"). Values internal to a component are called its state.
    The two primary ways of declaring components in React are through function components and class components.`,

    fullDesc: `Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code 
    readability with the use of significant indentation.
    Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured 
    (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" 
    language due to its comprehensive standard library.
    Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first 
    released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision 
    not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.
    Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.
    Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands
     as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and 
     interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.Van Rossum shouldered sole 
     responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation"
      from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to
       reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers
        elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.`,

      PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
    PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway 
    Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type
     of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web 
     template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or 
     facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web 
     context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.PHP code can also be directly executed 
     from the command line.
    The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been
     widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.
    The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation 
    acting as the de facto standard that other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal
     PHP specification.W3Techs reports that as of September 2023, "PHP is used by 77.0% of all the websites whose server-side
      programming language we know."[19] It also reports that only 16.7% of PHP users use the currently supported 8.x versions.
       Most by far use the unsupported PHP 7, more specifically PHP 7.4, while 20% use PHP 5 (slightly more than use the
         supported PHP 8.x), which is not supported with security fixes and is known to have serious security vulnerabilities. 
         This most likely indicates that these websites are vulnerable, those using 5.x, while it not does not necessarily 
         indicate that for those using 7.x, since Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Debian provide commercial support,
          and it may provide security patches for some unsupported 7.x versions such as 7.4 of PHP.`,

    Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
    Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run
     JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's 
     web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development
      around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.
    Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput
     and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications 
     (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).
    The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with 
    the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative 
    Projects program.Node.js was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009,about thirteen years after the introduction of the 
    first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux and Mac 
    OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.
    Dahl criticized the limited possibilities of the most popular web server in 2009, Apache HTTP Server, to handle a lot 
    of concurrent connections (up to 10,000 and more) and the most common way of creating code (sequential programming), when 
    code either blocked the entire process or implied multiple execution stacks in the case of simultaneous connections.
    Dahl demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009.[14][15][16] Node.js combined Google's 
    V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.`,
